## About

Hi Everyone, I'm <span class="important-text">Jorge Núñez Santiago</span> from Vigo, Spain.

I am a <span class="important-text">machine learning developer</span>, focused on Computer Vision, with a strong interest in software development. I work mainly on the generation of deep learning models and the development and deployment of the pipeline to put these models into production, especially in object detection and classification applications.

I am currently working at Antexia Technologies S.L., a new company owned by <a href="https://www.indracompany.com/" target="_blank">Indra</a>, as a deep learning engineer.
