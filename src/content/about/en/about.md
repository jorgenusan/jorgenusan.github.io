## About

I am a machine learning developer, focused on computer vision, with great interest in other branches such as pure backend and frontend development. I work mainly on the generation of deep learning models and the development of applications for the integration and production of these models, especially in object detection and classification applications.

I am currently working at Antexia Technologies SL, a new company owned by [Indra](https://www.indracompany.com/), as a deep learning engineer. Previously I worked at [Gradiant](https://www.gradiant.org/) as a machine learning researcher, in the machine vision area, and before that as a full stack developer at [Coremain](https://www.coremain.com/).

I have studied multiplatform application development and I specialized in machine learning doing the specialization course in artificial intelligence and big data in Vigo, Spain.
